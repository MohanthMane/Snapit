# Snapit

Snap it is an android app that detects the real world objects around us using  Firebase MLKit API. This app also comes with a game mode where the computer asks the user to show some objects( If shown, the score will be incremented). 
Currently, there are two modes (Game mode and Detection mode) in this app. Next step is to integrate a multiplayer feature.
